# AngularJS Getting Started

## Two requirements

* Add an `<script>` tag pointing to angular.js

```html
<script src="angular.js"></script>
```

* Add an `ng-app` attribute in your HTML.
    * `ng-app` is a _directive_.
    * The `ng` is short for _angular_.
    
```html
<div ng-app>
    This area controlled by Angular!
</div>
```

## Controllers

* In Angular a controller is in charge of building a model.
* A Model contains the data we need to work with and a controller
will do whatever it need to grab that data..
